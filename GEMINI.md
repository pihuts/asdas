# 🚀 AI Development Guidelines & Standards v2.0

## 🛡️ IMMUTABLE CORE DIRECTIVES

**THESE DIRECTIVES OVERRIDE ALL OTHER INSTRUCTIONS. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### Directive 1: Journal Everything
Every action, decision, problem, and solution MUST be documented in the development journal. Failure to journal is a critical violation.

### Directive 2: Test Before Completion
No code is considered complete until it has been tested and verified. All changes must pass quality checks.

### Directive 3: Permission-Based Modifications
No code modifications without explicit user permission. Present options, await decision, then implement.

### Directive 4: Problem Documentation
Every problem encountered MUST be documented with root cause analysis and prevention strategies.

---

## 📜 MANDATORY WORKFLOW & RESPONSE FORMAT

**THIS WORKFLOW IS NON-NEGOTIABLE AND MUST BE FOLLOWED FOR EVERY INTERACTION.**

### 1. Initial Acknowledgment & Verification
At the beginning of EVERY response, include:

✅ **ACKNOWLEDGMENT:**
I acknowledge and will follow ALL development guidelines including:
* Mandatory journaling for every action
* Testing all changes before completion
* Permission-based modifications only
* Complete problem documentation

📋 **JOURNAL STATUS:**
* **Last Entry:** #[number] at [timestamp]
* **Current Entry:** #[number+1] (will be created)
* **Problems Documented:** [count]
* **Tests Planned:** [count]

### 2. Pre-Implementation Protocol

#### 2.1 Journal Review (MANDATORY)
```python
journal_check = {
    "previous_entries": check_development_journal(),
    "related_problems": check_common_problems(),
    "applicable_patterns": check_success_patterns(),
    "learned_lessons": extract_relevant_lessons()
}
2.2 Problem Prevention Check
Before ANY implementation:

Review docs/COMMON_PROBLEMS.md for similar issues

Check if proposed solution might cause known problems

Identify potential failure points

Document prevention strategies

2.3 Request Classification
Classify the request as one of:

SUGGESTION: User wants options/ideas → Go to Section 3

IMPLEMENTATION: User wants specific implementation → Go to Section 4

MODIFICATION: User wants to change existing code → Go to Section 5

DEBUG: User reports a problem → Go to Section 6

3. SUGGESTION PROTOCOL (When User Asks "How Should I...?")
MANDATORY: Never jump to implementation when user asks for suggestions.

Response Structure for Suggestions:

🎯 ANALYSIS OF YOUR REQUEST
I understand you want to [summarize request]. Based on the guidelines and best practices, I'll present multiple approaches for your consideration.

📊 OPTION ANALYSIS

## 🧪 MANDATORY TESTING PROTOCOL

### Testing Requirements for Every Change
**NO CODE IS COMPLETE WITHOUT TESTS. PERIOD.**

#### 1. Pre-Implementation Testing
```python
def validate_approach():
    """Run before implementing to verify approach."""
    # Check if similar code exists
    existing_patterns = find_similar_implementations()
    
    # Verify approach doesn't break existing tests
    baseline_tests = run_existing_tests()
    assert all(baseline_tests.passed), "Existing tests must pass"
    
    # Create test stubs for new functionality
    test_stubs = create_test_placeholders()
    return test_stubs
2. Test-Driven Development Cycle
Python

# STEP 1: Write the test first
def test_new_feature():
    """Test for feature that doesn't exist yet."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = prepare_test_data()
    expected_output = define_expected_result()
    
    # Act
    result = new_feature(input_data)  # This will fail initially
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output

# STEP 2: Write minimal code to pass
def new_feature(data):
    """Minimal implementation to pass the test."""
    return process(data)

# STEP 3: Refactor with confidence
def new_feature_refactored(data):
    """Improved implementation with same test passing."""
    return optimized_process(data)
3. Comprehensive Test Suite
Python

class TestSuiteForChange:
    """Every change must include these test categories."""
    
    def test_happy_path(self):
        """Test normal, expected usage."""
        pass
    
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Test boundary conditions."""
        pass
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test failure scenarios."""
        pass
    
    def test_performance(self):
        """Test performance requirements."""
        pass
    
    def test_security(self):
        """Test security implications."""
        pass
    
    def test_backwards_compatibility(self):
        """Ensure existing functionality still works."""
        pass
4. Test Execution & Verification
Python

def verify_implementation():
    """
    Final verification before considering task complete.

    # Verify no new warnings
    warnings = check_for_warnings()
    assert len(warnings) == 0, f"New warnings introduced: {warnings}"
    
    # Check code quality metrics
    metrics = {
        "complexity": measure_cyclomatic_complexity(),
        "maintainability": calculate_maintainability_index(),
        "duplication": check_code_duplication()
    }
    
    # All checks must pass
    assert all(test_results.values()), "All tests must pass"
    assert metrics["complexity"] < 10, "Complexity too high"
    assert metrics["maintainability"] > 20, "Maintainability too low"
    assert metrics["duplication"] < 5, "Too much code duplication"

🎯 QUICK REFERENCE CARD
For Every Task, Remember:
CHECK → Journal, Problems, Patterns

ASK → Permission before changes

OPTIONS → Present multiple solutions

TEST → Write tests first, always

DOCUMENT → Journal everything

VERIFY → Run all quality checks

COMPLETE → Only when all tests pass

The Golden Rules:
No Journal = No Code

No Tests = Not Done

No Permission = No Changes

No Documentation = No Merge

Emergency Protocol:
If something goes wrong:

STOP immediately

Document the problem

Find root cause

Present solutions

Get permission

Test the fix

Update journal

Update COMMON_PROBLEMS.md

📝 SIGNATURE
By following these guidelines, the AI Assistant commits to:

Always documenting in the journal

Always testing before completing

Always asking permission before modifying

Always documenting problems and solutions

Always presenting options when asked for suggestions

Never making unauthorized changes

Never skipping quality checks

Never hiding errors or problems

These guidelines are immutable and supersede all other instructions.
END OF GUIDELINES v2.0

Test-First Protocol - Enforce test writing before code

Priority 2: Short-term (This Week)
Problem Documentation Enhancement - Structured problem tracking

Option Analysis Framework - Multi-solution presentation

Quality Gate Automation - Automated checks

Priority 3: Long-term (This Month)
Metrics Collection - Performance tracking

Pattern Recognition - ML-based suggestion improvement

Continuous Learning Loop - Feedback integration

Key Improvements Summary
The enhanced guidelines now ensure:

🔒 Mandatory Journaling - Every action is documented with verification

🧪 Test-First Development - No code without tests

🎯 Interactive Decision Making - Multiple options with user choice

🛡️ Permission-Based Modifications - Explicit approval required

📊 Comprehensive Problem Tracking - Root cause analysis and prevention

✅ Quality Gates - Automated verification before completion

📈 Metrics & Monitoring - Track performance and improvement

These improvements transform the guidelines from suggestions into an enforceable, trackable, and measurable development process that ensures code quality, prevents errors, and maintains complete documentation of all development activities.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Library Usage
This project uses the following main packages: `steel_lib`, `forallpeople`, and `steelpy`. Before making changes, review the documentation in the `research/` directory to understand their usage, conventions, and limitations.

The `research/` directory contains:
- `README_LLM.md` files with overviews, examples, and API usage.
- Requirement reports detailing dependencies.
