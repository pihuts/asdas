## Dependency File Analysis

- **`pyproject.toml`**: This file is present in the root of the repository, but its contents could not be accessed for automated analysis.
- **`requirements.txt`**: This file is present in the repository but is empty.

## Deduced Dependencies

Based on the project's documentation and `README` file, the library has the following characteristics regarding dependencies:

- **Core Dependencies**: The library appears to be designed with minimal to no hard dependencies, aiming for a small footprint.
- **Vendored Libraries**: The `tuplevector` library for vector arithmetic is mentioned as being "baked in" (vendored) with `forallpeople`, so it does not need to be installed separately.

## Compatibility

The library is designed to be compatible with and used alongside several common scientific Python libraries, though they are not strict requirements for its core functionality:

- **`numpy`**: For performing numerical operations, especially with matrices.
- **`pandas`**: For data analysis workflows.
- **`handcalcs`**: For rendering calculations in a human-readable format.
- **`jupyter`**: For interactive computing and rich display of units.
